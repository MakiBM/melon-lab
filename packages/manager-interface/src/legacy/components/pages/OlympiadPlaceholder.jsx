      <i>([méllō], μέλλω; Greek for “destined to be”)</i> is blockchain software
      that seeks to enable participants to set up, manage and invest in
      technology regulated investment funds in a way that reduces barriers to
      entry, while minimizing the requirements for trust.{' '}

      An Olympiad <i>([əˈlɪmpɪad], Ὀλυμπιάς)</i> is a period of four years
      associated with the Olympic Games of the Ancient Greeks. During the
      Hellenistic period, beginning with Ephorus, it was used as a calendar
      epoch.

        The Melon Olympiad is a series of blockchain-based asset management
        competitions composed of several rounds. Each of the rounds will set a
        clear goal for participants, and will issue a defined number of Melon
        tokens.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Following a successful token sale in 2017, Melonport AG is left with
      500,600 Melon (MLN) tokens to distribute. Rather than distribute these in
      a traditional manner, Melonport has created a series of sub-contribution
      periods called Melon Olympiad. This will ensure that tokens are allocated
      to active community members who engage and use the Melon asset management
      ecosystem. The distribution of up to half a million Melon tokens will
      largely occur via a public contribution period is in keeping with
      Melonport’s commitment to creating a diverse and decentralized ecosystem
      in which there are as many participants as possible. By awarding tokens to
      testers who have put their time and energy into scrutinizing the Melon
      software, it will also ensure adoption and help to further improve the
      codebase. The contribution period will be split into rounds referred to as
      Melon Olympiad capsules, with a portion of tokens allocated for each
      stage. Upon completion of the Melon Olympiad, all 500,600 tokens will have
      been issued. In keeping with the mythology and provenance of the Olympic
      Games, each round will be named after a Greek island, commencing with
      Paros. Participants will be obliged to create a fund and send Ether to the
      relevant Olympiad smart-contract, which will then be matched with an
      equivalent amount of MLN tokens plus an additional incentive amount. It is
      then up to the participant to manage the fund for a period of one month
      with a view to maximizing capital appreciation. The Melon Protocol intends
      to present a decentralized, public, permissionless, robust infrastructure
      for the secure management of digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. It
      aims to be a viable, low-cost alternative to the current fund management
      ecosystem which has evolved similarly across most legal jurisdictions. The
      protocol itself is a collection of smart-contracts written in the Solidity
      programming language. Supporting functionality that allows browsers to
      freely interact with the protocol is provided by the javascript library
      Melon.js. For more information visit: https://docs.melonport.com and our
      github https://github.com/melonproject/. Participants interested in taking
      part in the Melon Olympiad Paros can register by following the
      instructions provided below.

      volatility).
