      <i>([méllō], μέλλω; Greek for “destined to be”)</i> is blockchain software
      that seeks to enable participants to set up, manage and invest in
      technology regulated investment funds in a way that reduces barriers to
      entry, while minimizing the requirements for trust.{' '}

    <p>
      An Olympiad <i>([əˈlɪmpɪad], Ὀλυμπιάς)</i> is a period of four years
      associated with the Olympic Games of the Ancient Greeks. During the
      Hellenistic period, beginning with Ephorus, it was used as a calendar
      epoch.

        The Melon Olympiad is a series of blockchain-based asset management
        competitions composed of several rounds. Each of the rounds will set a
        clear goal for participants, and will issue a defined number of Melon
        tokens.
      </strong>{' '}
      At the end of the Melon Olympiad, all remaining Melon tokens shall have
      been issued to the public. {' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>
        {' '}
        Each round of the Melon Olympiad will be named after Greek islands. The
        first round of the Melon Olympiad is referred to as Paros.

    </p>
    <h2>Melon Olympiad, first round: Paros</h2>
    <p>
      Participants who wish to engage in testing and help us improve the
      software will be rewarded for this effort. Participants will have to
      create a fund on this website and contribute ether to the Olympiad
      contract. In return, the Olympiad contract will invest the equivalent
      amount in MLN (+ a bonus) into the participant’s fund. The participant
      will have to manage his fund for a defined period of time (2 weeks) with
      the goal being capital appreciation. At the end of the defined management
      period, the participant will be able to trigger the redemption of the
      fund’s assets, thus receiving the fund’s AUM as a reward for his effort.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Paros round, the participant compensation is as follows: for each
      ether contributed, the participant will receive the equivalent of 2 ethers
      in Melon tokens. The conversion rate of ether to Melon will be retrieved
      from the Pricefeed contract.
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions on how to participate</h2>
    <p>
